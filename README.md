Problem Solvings/ lessons learned:

- Live Server didn't work because I had the full path of the style-sheet in the html-head instead of only the stylesheet-file-name. Since the CSS file is in the same folder like the html-file, the paths dioesnt need to be written entirely. The same applies to the photo, for whoch not the whole path, but only the paths to the image folder needs to be specifie ("image/SingleCup.jpg") 
- Trabnsparent collapsed bar didn't show up. I thought that collapsing didnt work, but everything was trabsparent because the navbar was transparent. It can be solves with JV that the collapsed nav-bar does get a color. But I couldnt find out how, yet.
