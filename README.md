This coffee shop website is my first website. I have coded it in the framnework of the practical assignment for the first cycle of the Web Development course at Frauenloop - Women in Tech (https://www.frauenloop.org/). 

In the initial planning phase, I have created moqup pages. At that stage, I planned to create a single page for each sections (home, about us, etc). In the course of the coding, I decided to make a one-site webpage for all content related to teh coffee shop/ NAD.café. Moreover, I ´made other contenta nd design related changes that are explained below. Hence, the moqup pages differ from the actual result as part of a learning and improvement process. 







Problem Solvings/ lessons learned:

- Live Server didn't work because I had the full path of the style-sheet in the html-head instead of only the stylesheet-file-name. Since the CSS file is in the same folder like the html-file, the paths dioesnt need to be written entirely. The same applies to the photo, for whoch not the whole path, but only the paths to the image folder needs to be specifie ("image/SingleCup.jpg") 
- Trabnsparent collapsed bar didn't show up. I thought that collapsing didnt work, but everything was trabsparent because the navbar was transparent. It can be solves with JV that the collapsed nav-bar does get a color. But I couldnt find out how, yet.
